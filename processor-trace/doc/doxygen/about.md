About the Intel(R) Processor Trace Decoder Library {#about}
=========================================================================

The Intel Processor Trace (PT) Decoder Library is Intel's reference
implementation for decoding Intel PT.  It can be used as a standalone library or
it can be partially or fully integrated into your tool.

The library comes with a set of sample tools built on top of it and a test
system built on top of the sample tools.  The samples demonstrate how to use the
library and may serve as a starting point for integrating the library into your
tool.
